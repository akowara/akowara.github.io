  <p>
    The purpose of this website is to share my experience at CIBC, as well as for me to have something to look back on and remember what I learned during my year
    long co-op work term. I am a fifth year student at the University of Guelph studying Software Engineering. I just finshed my third work term at CIBC, fifth overall. I enrolled
    in co-op to gain experience and explore different opportunities for software engineers. This co-op position introduced me to performance testing, and the various other postions part of the software release
    process. After finishing this work term, I would be intrested in coming back to performance, but I first would like to finish my degree and
    try other areas of computer science, such as machine learning.

  <hr>
  <p>CIBC is one of Canada's largest banks, with a diverse range of financial services and products, making it a great place to develop a career 
  in the financial and technical industries. I am responsible for evaluating and measuring the performance, speed, and stability of CIBC online 
  banking and their native applications under different workloads.  As a performance tester, I employ various frameworks, including 
  Python-based Robot and C-based Virtual User Generator. The Virtual User Generator scripts are executed using LoadRunner, a performance testing 
  tool that assesses the performance, speed, scalability, and reliability of applications. The tests aim to gather metrics such as response time, 
  memory usage, and CPU usage, which are then analyzed to ensure they meet business requirements. If necessary, I will request fixes to optimize performance. </p>
