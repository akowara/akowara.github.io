      <p style ="width:800px">Arthur is a person I was able to trust and rely on his independence a lot. He worked on his own most of the time and I did not feel the need to get involved and teach him much when it comes to tech stack or syntax. He learned new tech related things on his own and only reached out to me to let me know that he has completed the task, to ask some business rules related questions or to ask for his next task.

  <h2><strong><center>Introduction</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to share my experience at Kenna, as well as for me to have something to look back on and remember what I learned during my second
    co-op work term. I am a third year student at the University of Guelph studying Software Engineering. I just finshed my second 4 month co-op work term. I enrolled
    in co-op to gain experience and explore different opportunities for software engineers. This co-op position introduced me to web application development, and the various program langauges
    used to develop these applications. After finishing this work term, I would be intrested in coming back to web application development, but I first would like
    to try other areas of computer science, such as data science.

  <p>kenna is a marketing solutions provider specializing in customer experience management. I worked on developing and maintaining the frontend and backend of web applications for one of their

  and the importance of a website's design.</p>

      <p>
        The most beneficial part of this work term was all of the important skills I learned and improved on. I went into the work term with only a basic
        knowledge of JavaScript, SQL, Node and React but after working with these for the past four months, I became fluent and confident with these technologies.
        If my next Job uses any of these technologies/langauges, I will be more confident and efficient from the begining of the new position. I also used Bitbucket for project management, which
        a lot of job postings ask for which would help me make a smooth transtion into my next job.

      <p>
        This job's posting made it very clear which technologies would be used, including JavaScript, SQL, Node, React, HTML and CSS. These technologies are a big reason that I chose
        this job as I was excited to learn them. At the beginning, I was slower using these technologies and not very profcient; however, as the work term moved along I became more
        efficient and was able to contribute more to kenna. I've heard that these technologies are high in demand in my  industry so I plan to keep building my knowledge of them to raise my value
        as a software engineer.

  <h2><strong><center>Reflecting On My Goals</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    I confidently believe that I achieved all of my goals through daily and weekly repition of the key aspects of this job. I went in with high expectations
    of learning a lot throughout the term, and I surpassed my expectations on how much I'd learn. From hard skills such as Javascript to soft skills such as team work,
    I came out of this term twice as good of a software engineer. From start to finish it always seemed as if I was learning something new everyday and
   continued building on these skills. I would definitely recommend this job to any software engineer looking to gain valuable skills, and build on their
    exsisting knowledge of web application development.

        Web Application Developers at kenna are responsible for developing, maintaining and debugging various web applications used by their clients. I was working on
        applications used by BASF Canada. One of the projects I worked on was a donation tool for the company. I worked on devloping the donation form and the edit
        history of the form, while following the business outline and stages given in the business report documentation. Throughout the term, I was given different tasks
        that had unique solutions. This caused the position to require a lot of out of the box thinking and solid problem solving skills. Coming into the position,
        I had pretty good problem solving skills, but after the work term I believe I significantly improved them.

  <h2><strong><center>Summary</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    To sum it up, my past work term was a great learning experience in which I gained a lot of useful knowledge and experience that is transferable in my second work term.
    I came into the job with three main goals, and with the help of my supervisor, I was able to accomplish all three goals very successfully. Going forward, I hope to use
    the skills and technologies learned to help me succeed in future work terms both during and post undergraduate degree.
