He worked on his own most of the time and I did not feel the need to get involved and teach him much when it comes to tech stack or syntax. He learned new tech related things on his own and only reached out to me to let me know that he has completed the task, to ask some business rules related questions or to ask for his next task.

  <h2><strong><center>Introduction</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to share my experience at Kenna, as well as for me to have something to look back on and remember what I learned during my second
    coop work term. I am a third year student at the University of Guelph studying Software Engineering. I just finshed my second 4 mouth coop work term. I enrolled
    in coop to gain experience and explore different opportunities for software engineers. This coop introduced me to web aplication development, and the various program langauges
    used to develop these applications. After finishing this work term, I would be intrested in comin back to web application development, but I first would like
    to try other aspects of areas of computer science, such as data science.

  <h2><strong><center>Benefits For Next Job</center></strong></h2>

    <td>
      <p>
        The most benfical part of this work term to my next work term is all the hard skills I learned and improved on. I went into the work term with only a basic
        knowledge of Javascript, SQL, Node and React, but after working with these for the past four months, I became fluent and confident with these technologies.
        If my next Job uses any of the technologies/langauges, I will be more confident and effcient from the begining of the new job. I also used Bitbucket for project management, which
        a lot of job postings ask for which would help me make a smooth transtion into the new job.

    <td>
      <p>
        This job's posting made it very clear which technologies would be used, Javascript, SQL, Node, React, HTML and CSS. These technologies are a big reason that I chose
        this job as I was excited to learn them. At the begining, I was slower using these technologies and not very profcient, but as the work term moved along I became more
        profcient and was able to contribute more to the company. I heard that these technologies are high in demand in this industry so I plan on keep building my knowledge of them to raise my value
        as a software engineer.

  <h2><strong><center>Reflecting On My Goals</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    I confidently beleieve that I achieved all my goals, tghrough daily and weekly repition of the key aspects of this job. I went in with high expectations
    of learning a lot throughout the term, and I surpassed my expectations on how much I'd learn. From hard skills such as Javascript to soft skills such as team work,
    I came out of this term twice as good of a software engineer as I came into it. From start to finsh it always seemed as if I learned something new everyday, and
    would continue building the skills everyday. I would definitely recommend this job to any software engineer looking to gain valuable skills, and build on their
    exsisting knowledge of web application development.

        Web Application Developers at Kenna are responsible for developing, maintaing and dbugging various we applications used by their clients. I was working on
        applications used by BASF Canada. One of the projects I worked on was a donation tool for the company. I worked on devloping the donation form and the edit
        history of the form, while following the buissiness outline and stages given in the buissiness report documentation. Through out the term, I was given different tasks
        that had unique solutions. This causes the position to require a lot of out of the box thinking and solid problem solving skills. Coming into the position,
        I had pretty good problem solving skills, but after the work term I believe I significantly improved them.

  <h2><strong><center>Summary</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    To sum it up, my past work term was a great learning experience in which I gained a lot of useful knowledge and experience that is transferable in my second work term.
    I came with three main goals, and with the help of my supervisor, I was able to accomplish all three goals very efficently. Going forward, I hope to use
    the skills and the technologies learned to help me succeed in future work terms and both during and post my undergraduate degree.
