  <h2><strong><center>Introduction</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to share my experience at CIBC, as well as for me to have something to look back on and remember what I learned during my third
    co-op work term. I am a fourth year student at the University of Guelph studying Software Engineering. I just finshed my first work term at CIBC, third overall. I enrolled
    in co-op to gain experience and explore different opportunities for software engineers. This co-op position introduced me to performance testing, and the various other postions part of the software release
    process. After finishing this work term, I would be intrested in coming back to performance, but I first would like to finish my degree and
    try other areas of computer science, such as data science.

  <h2><strong><center>About <a href="https://www.cibconline.cibc.com/">CIBC</a></center></strong></h2>
  <hr>
  <p>CIBC is one of Canada's largest banks, with a diverse range of financial services and products, making it a great place to develop a career 
  in the financial and technical industries. I am responsible for evaluating and measuring the performance, speed, and stability of CIBC online 
  banking and their native applications under different workloads.  In my work as a performance tester, I employ various frameworks, including 
  Python-based Robot and C-based Virtual User Generator. The Virtual User Generator scripts are executed using LoadRunner, a performance testing 
  tool that assesses the performance, speed, scalability, and reliability of applications. The tests aim to gather metrics such as response time, 
  memory usage, and CPU usage, which are then analyzed to ensure they meet business requirements. If necessary, I will request fixes to optimize performance. </p>

      <p>
        The most beneficial part of this work term was the knowledge I gained of what goes into software releases. I went into the work term with not much knowledge of performance testing,
        but after working with within a team I learned the imprtance and techniques of performance testing. In the past four months, I became more confident with the system's bussiness flows and gained a better understanding of the overall system's functionalities.
        I also used Jira and Git for project management, which a lot of job postings ask for which would help me make a smooth transtion into my next job.

        Coming into the job, I was initially uncertain about the technologies in use. However, it quickly became apparent that multiple automation frameworks would be utilized. 
        My primary tool is Robot, a Python-based framework, which enables me to establish virtual connections with mobile devices and execute scripts controlling the devices 
        through test cases. It tracks the duration of each test case and outputs the times to a text file. Additionally, Virtual User Generator, a component of LoadRunner, 
        is employed. These scripts facilitate load testing to simulate user interactions with the bank's applications, providing performance measurements such as response time, CPU usage, and memory utilization.

  <h2><strong><center>Reflecting On My Goals</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    I confidently believe that I am progressing well for all of my goals through daily and weekly repition of the key aspects of this job. I went in with high expectations
    of learning a lot throughout the term, and I surpassed my expectations on how much I'd learn. From hard skills such as performance test scripting to soft skills such as team work,
    I came out of this term as a better software engineer. From the first four months it always seems that I am learning something new everyday and
    continue building on these skills. I would definitely recommend this job to any software engineer looking to gain valuable skills, and build on their
    exsisting knowledge of performance testing.

        Performance test analysts at CIBC are responsible for gathering requirements, building, scripting, and running test cases, running baseline tests with various loads, and analyzing 
        the results through comparison reports. All of these tests and reports serve the same purpose: to ensure that the performance of these applications meets the standard set by the business, 
        which is usually a 3-second response time. One project that stood out for me was working on the new Simplii Chatbot. 
        While working on the Simplii Chatbot, I was able to go through this process from start to finish. From the description, 
        the process seems straightforward, but once it started, it required raising many defects and making changes to the plan. 
        This is when I had to meet with various different teams and help create a new plan to fix these problems. Going through this 
        process taught me how to work within a team and manage my time better.

  <p>
    To sum it up, my past work term was a great learning experience in which I gained a lot of useful knowledge and experience that will allow me to build on during the next work term.
    I came into the job with three main goals, and with the help of the team, I was able to build a solid foundation to continue learning and contribute to CIBC's success. At the end of the year, I hope to use
    the skills and technologies learned to help me succeed in my future career.
