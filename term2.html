        The second half of the term especially focused on my analytical thinking and presenting 
        skills, on top of the scripting skills developed in the first half. I still executed 
        Robot Framework UX tests; however, most of my focus was spent on analyzing data and 
        presenting my findings. I was in charge of monthly reports, which included collecting, 
        analyzing, and presenting data collected through the various performance tests we ran 
        the past month. I want to get into machine learning for my next job, and I believe these 
        skills are highly applicable in the field. Additionally, I was able to really improve my 
        scripting and coding efficiency, which will really help me at my next job and at school as well.

        For the second half of the term, I mostly worked with Robot Framework, XCode, and Microsoft Office. 
        I focused on creating and executing UX test scripts within Robot Framework. These scripts captured 
        the performance of applications on different environments. The Robot Framework was used to automate 
        the test cases and calculated the response times. Typically, these scripts underwent 20 iterations, 
        and the average response time was the final result I was looking for.
        One of the devices I tested was a MacBook Pro, which required setting up and configuring an XCode project. 
        Moving on to the monthly reports,  I used Microsoft Office to analyze and present the data. Using macros 
        in Excel, I identified trends and outliers in the data collected over the previous month. Once the data 
        was organized, I used PowerPoint to visually represent and present the monthly trends observed in the business applications.

  <h2><strong><center>Reflecting On My Goals</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    One of the biggest questions I had going into this term was whether this 
    job was worth delaying my graduation by a year. I believed that if I achieved 
    the goals I set out at the beginning of the term, it would have been worth it. 
    Most importantly, I wanted to create new connections and gain valuable work 
    experience. Reflecting on the past year, I was able to create new connections 
    with employees from different sectors of the bank, and I've had conversations 
    about my future in the bank since leaving my work term. Secondly, I was able 
    to enhance my scripting and Python skills significantly by creating and running 
    test cases every day. In a fast-paced working environment, I improved my soft 
    skills, such as time management, multitasking, and presenting, just to name a 
    few.I would highly recommend this job to any software engineer seeking to 
    acquire valuable skills and enhance their existing knowledge of performance testing.

        Performance test analysts at CIBC are responsible for gathering requirements, building, 
        scripting, and running test cases, running baseline tests with various loads, and analyzing 
        the results through comparison reports. All of these tests and reports serve the same purpose: 
        to ensure that the performance of these applications meets the standard set by the business, 
        which is usually a 3-second response time. For the monthly report, I had to ensure that the 
        delta between months was less than 0.5 seconds. From the second half of this term, the monthly 
        reports became my main focus, teaching me the importance of the values we calculate on the 
        business side of the bank. There were strict deadlines that really helped develop my skills 
        in working under pressure and communicating with different teams about discrepancies with 
        the values collected.

  <h2><strong><center>Summary</center></strong></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    In summary, my previous year at CIBC provided me with an excellent experience 
    and learning opportunity. I am confident that I made the right choice to delay 
    my graduation for the work term. From developing my hard skills to networking, 
    CIBC enabled me to achieve all the goals I set out to accomplish. I anticipate 
    being able to apply these skills in my future career.
